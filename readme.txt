>If you find any issues, please consider requesting free support before leaving feedback.

>This plugin is not just a simple and singular piece of information from your WordPress memory available. It's a **comprehensive set of tools** to help you manage your website's memory. For example, hardware memory, PHP memory, and WordPress memory limits.It confirms that your **hosting is indeed delivering the promised hardware memory size**.

But it goes further: it alerts you when memory is dangerously low, especially if it's already depleted. It also keeps a log of how much memory each page has occupied, as different pages use varying amounts of memory. Additionally, it logs errors from your server. While WordPress only notifies you of fatal errors, it doesn't alert you to other issues that can also impact your site's performance, making it slower or hindering navigation, and preventing users from seeing things correctly.

Premium Version: Say goodbye to complex coding and the risk of accidental file changes. WP Memory Check allows you to effortlessly **fix both the PHP Memory Limit and the WordPress Memory Limit** without the need for intricate coding modifications or the fear of unintended file alterations.

Take action and install the WPmemory plugin today to free yourself from memory constraints. With WPmemory, you can focus on what truly matters: crafting remarkable content, engaging your audience and unlock your creative potential.
